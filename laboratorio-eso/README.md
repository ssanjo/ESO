# Projects for `Estructura de Sistemas Operativos`

This repository holds a number of projects that can be used in an operating
systems class aimed at upper-level undergraduates and (in some cases)
beginning graduate students. They are based on years of teaching such a course
at the University of Wisconsin-Madison. This version is adapted for
`Estructura de Sistemas Operativos` course

Also (increasingly) available are some tests to see if your code works; eventually
every project will have a set of tests available. The testing framework that is
currently available is found [here](https://github.com/remzi-arpacidusseau/ostep-projects/tree/master/tester).
A specific testing script, found in each project directory, can be used to run
the tests against your code. 

For example, in the initial utilities project, the relatively simple `UVacat`
program that you create can be tested by running the `test-UVacat.sh` script.
This could be accomplished by the following commands:
```sh
prompt> git clone https://github.com/bsahelices/laboratorio-eso
prompt> cd laboratorio-eso/Practica1/UVacat
prompt> emacs -nw UVacat.c  or vi UVacat.c
prompt> gcc -o UVacat UVacat.c -Wall -Werror
prompt> ./test-UVacat.sh
test 1: passed
test 2: passed
test 3: passed
test 4: passed
test 5: passed
test 6: passed
test 7: passed
prompt> 
```
Of course, this sequence assumes (a) you use `emacs` or vi, (b) your
code is written in one shot (impressive!), and (c) that it works perfectly
(well done!). Even for simple assignments, it is likely that the
compile/run/debug cycle might take a few iterations.

Also, if you want to check all tests without stopping in the failing ones,
use the option -c:

```sh
prompt> ./test-UVacat.sh -c
```


## C/Linux Projects

### Initial Projects

These projects are meant to get you warmed up with programming in the C/UNIX
environment. None are meant to be particularly hard, but should be enough so
that you can get more comfortable programming. 

Realize the best thing you can do to learn to program in any environment is to
program **a lot**. These small projects are only the beginning of that
journey; you'll have to do more on your own to truly become proficient.

* Unix Utilities (cat, grep, zip/unzip)
* Reverse (very simple reverse program)

### Processes and Scheduling

* Shell 


## Kernel Hacking Projects (Minix)

These projects all are to be done with Minix operating system. 
See ESO main page in Moodle. Unlike the C/Linux projects, these give
you direct experience inside a real, working operating system (albeit a simple
one).
